Having spent their lives fighting for dominace in their clan, these brutes have learned how to instill fear in their opponents. While this is effective in one on one battles, and often brings the mean orcs high into the hierachy, it presents a problem for them when they are unable to intimidate themselves to a higher position.

When a mean orc cannot rise further within the clan, they often find themself without any skills with which to be useful. With half the clan being too terrified to work with them, they are not useful to the community, and are thus often thrown out.

Thus Mean Orcs are often lone figures, wandering without purpose from one robbery to the next. However, should one raise to the top of a clan, it will often lead to a short stint of terror and violence before it's subjects or a group of adventurers depose it.
